## What is a story?

* Oxford English Dictionary: a narrative (or story) is any fictional or nonfictional reports of connected events, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or in a sequence of (moving) pictures.
* Aristtle: A story (mythos) must have a begginning, a middle and an end, and the events must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable. Stories arouse emotion in the psyche
of the audience.
* Russian formalists: The fabula (Story) is what hapened in chronological order. The syuzhet (Plot) is the sequence of discourse that was sorted out by the (implied) author. That is, the syuzhet consists of picking up
the fabula events in non-chronological order, e.g. Fabula = <a1, a2, a3, ..., an>, Syuzhet=<a3, a1, a4, ...>.
* Marie-Laure Ryan:
    1. Story takes place in a world populated with individuated agents (characters) and objects (spacial dimension).
    2. This world must undergo not fully predictable changes of the state that are caused by non-habitual physical events: either accidents or deliberate actions by intelligent agents.
    3. In addition to begin linked to physical states by causal relations, the physical events must be associated ...
* Mckee: a story is a series of acts that builds to a climax which brings about absolute and irreversible change.
* Syd Field: a story is a three act structure. 
    1. The main character protagonist experiences a plot point ...
    2. ...
    3. ...

### Story vs. Plot (Forster)

* Story: King dies and queen dies => event follows event
* Plot: King dies and then queen dies of gried => event causes emotion causes event

### Aristotle's Poetics

* Plot (mythos) = sequence of events linked by necessity or probability
* The Odissey
* Common patterns:
    * Recognition (ignorance to knowledge)
    * Reversal of fortune (peripetia)
    * Complication + Turning Point + Unraveling

### Freytag's triangle

1. Exposition
2. Rising action

### Rumelhart: story grammars

* Story: Settings + Episode
* Setting -> State
* Episode -> Event + Emotion
* Event -> Event + Event
* Event -> Episode
* Event -> Action

#### Example

1. Althea was in the playroom.
1. She sat on the balloon.
1. It popped.
1. She was pleased.

Story:
* Setting **ALLOWS** Episode
* State **ALLOWS** Episode
* 1 **ALLOWS** Episode
* 1 **ALLOWS** (Event **CAUSES** Emotion)
* 1 **ALLOWS** ((Event **CAUSES** Event) **CAUSES** Emotion)
* 1 **ALLOWS** ((Action **CAUSES** Action) **CAUSES** Emotion)
* 1 **ALLOWS** ((2 **CAUSES** 3) **CAUSES** 4)

Althea was in the playroom **ALLOWS** ((She sat on the balloon **CAUSES** it popped) **CAUSES** She was pleased.)

### Built Tale by Correira

* Story -> Setting + Episode
* Episode -> Episode + Interlude + Episode
* Episode -> Complication + Episode
* Episode -> Complication + Resolution


* Using macrostructures (Van Dijk)
* Hard to maintain coherence in the story
* Add parameters and constraints

### Todorov

#### Grammar of the decameron

* Narrative categories: Nouns, adjectives, verbs
* Nouns X, Y for characters in the story
* Adjectives A, B for states (happy/unhappy), properties (good/bad, intelligent/stupid) and status (husband/wife/lover, noble)
* Verbs a, b for actions: disguise, joke, attack, calling for help, traveling, giving and taking, buying and selling, infraction/punishment, etc.

#### Relations

* Emphasis/Repetition Xa + Xa
* Inversion Xa + X-a
* Modification Xa -> Xb
* Desire X opt A
* Motivation Xa -> P
* Result P -> Xa
* Punishment Xa -> YbX
* Hypothesis (XA -> XB)cond + XA -> X

#### Modes

* Assertive
* Obligative (law, punishment)
* Optative (desire) X opt a, X opt Y opt a
* Vision (belief) X(Ya)
* Conditional (test, promise) X cond (Yb -> Xc)
* Predictive (supposition) X pred (Yb -> Yc)

#### Grammar of the Decameron

* Two obligatory relations: Desire and modification
* Any number of auxiliary relations
* Combination of story lines
    * Sequential A + B
    * Embedded A + B + A
    * Alternating A + B + A + B

### Bremond

#### Logic of narrative possibilities

* Narrative atom: goal + action + outcome
* Amelioration or degradation
* Interactions: agression, assistance, intervention of ally, negociation, elimination of the adversary, retribution
* Combinations: end-to-end or enclave or coupling

```
Virtuality ---> | Actualization                     ---> | Goal attained (eg. act successful)
                | act necessary to attain goal           | Goal not attained (eg. act fails)
                | inertia, impediment to action

Amelioration to obtain ---> | Process of amelioration ---> Amelioration obtained/not obtained
                            |Â No process

...
```
