# Lesson #3 - Time and Space

## Outline

1. Narrative space and time
2. Examples in films and games
3. Reasoning about time and change

* Genette's typology of narrative space & time
* Burch's taxonomy of filmic space and time
* Reasoning about time and change
* Discrete Event Calculus
* Some examples:
    * The snowman
    * Paris, I Love You
    * Back to the future
    * New disorders: Pulp fiction, Inception, Memento, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 
    
## Genette: The narrative instance

* The narrative instance is said to be the conjuction between:
    1. narravie voice (who is speaking?)
    2. time of the narration (when does the telling occur, relatively to the story?)
    3. narrative perspective (though whom are we perceiving?)
* As with narrative mood, by examining the narrative instance we can gain a better understanding of the relations between the narrator and the story in a given narrative

### The narrative voice
* If the narrator lets signs of his presence appear in the narrative he is recounting, he may acquire a particular status, depending on the way the story is rendered. « We will therefore distinguish here two types of narrative: one with the narrator absent from the story he tells [...], the other with the narrator present as a character in the story he tells [...], I call the first type, for obvious reasons, heterodiegetic, and the second type homodiegetic.»

* In addition, if the homodiegetic narrator is the hero of the story, he/she is called autodiegetic.

### The time of the narration

* The narrator is always in a specific temporal position relative to the story he/she is telling. Genette describes four kinds of narration:

    1. Subsequent narration: this is the most common temporal position. The narrator tells what appened in some past time.
    1. Prior narration: the narrator tells what is going to happen at some future time. This kind of narration often takes the form of a dream or prophecy.
    1. Simultaneous narration: the narrator tells his/her story at the very moment it occurs.
    1. Interpolated narration: this complex type of narration combines subsequent and simultaneous narration. For example, a narrator tells what he experienced during the day (after the fact), and also includes his current impressions about this events. 

### The narrative perspective

* A distinction should be made between narrative voice and narrative perspective: the latter is the point of view
adopted by the narrator, which Genette calls focalization. 
« So by focalization I certainly mean a restriction of 'field' - actually, that is a selection
of narrative information with respect to what was traditionnally called omniscience. » 
These are matters of perception: the one who perceives is not necessarily the one who tells, and vice-versa.

* Genette distinguishes three kinds of focalization:

    1. Zero focalization: the narrator knows more than the characters. He may know the facts about all of the protagonists, as well as their thoughts and gestures. This is the traditional "omniscient narrator".
    1. Internal focalization: the narrator  knows as much as the focal character. This character filters the information provided
    to the reader. He cannot report the thoughts of other characters.
    1. External focalization: the narrator knows less than the characters. He acts a bit like a camera lens, following the
    protagonists action and gestures from the outside: he is unable to guess their thoughts. 

## Analepsis and Prolepsis

* What is commonly referred to in films as "flashback" and "flashforward". In other words, these are ways in which a narrative's discourse re-order's a given story: by "flashing back" to an earlier point in the story (analepsis) or "flashing forward"
to a moment later in the chronological sequence of events (prolepsis).

* The classical example of prolepsis is prophecy, as when Oedipus is told that he will sleep with his mother and kill his 
father. As we learn later in Sophocles' play, he does both despite his efforts to evade his fate.

### Frequency

* An event can occur once and be narrated once (singular). *« Today, I went to the shop. »*

* An event can occur n times and be narrated once (iterative). *« I used to go to the shop. »*

* An event can occur once and be narrated n times (repetitive). *« Today I went to the shop. » + « Today he went to the shop. »*

* An event can occur n times and be narrated n times (multiple). *« I used to go to the shop. » + « He used to go to the shop. » + « I went to the shop yesterday. » + etc.*

## Order

* Say in the story is narrated as follows: the clues of a murder are discovered by a detective (event A) ; the circumstances 
of the murder are finally revealed (event B) ; and lastly the murderer is caught (event C).

* Add corresponding numbers to the lettered events that represent their order chronologically: 1, 2 and 3.

* If these events were described chronologically, they would run B1, A2, C3. Arranged in the text, however, they run A2 
(discovery), ...


## Duration

* The separation between an event and its narration means that there is discourse time and narrative time These are the two main elements of duration.

* « Five years passed », has a lengthy narrative time, five years, but a short discourse time (it only took a second to read).

* James Joyce's novel Ulysses has a relatively short narrative time, 24h. Not many people, however, could read Ulysses in 24h. Thus it is safe to say it has a lenghy discourse time. 


## Todorov on the narrator

* Narrator > Character

* Narrator = Character

* Narrator < CHaracter

* Dramatic irony: the audience knows something the characters do not. As a result, the words of the characters take on a different meaning. This can create suspense or humour. Examples:
    
    * In Romeo and Juliet, Romeo thinks Juliet is dead and the audience knows she is not.
    * In Hamlet, we are aware that Hamlet knows the truth about his father's murder and that Hamlet is not mad.
    * In King Lear, we know that Lear's most loyal daughter Cordelia and he can't see it.
    * In Star Wars, Luke does not know Darth Vader is his father until Episode V, but the audience knows sooner.
    * In Groundhog Day, the audience and Phil know that Droundhog Day is repeating but the other people do not know this.

### Dramatic irony in Hitchcock

* The audience is longin to warn the characters on the screen: « You shouldn't be talking about such trivial matters. Ther's a bomb beneath you and it's about to explode! »

* In Rope, the audience sees the murder at the beginning of the movie. This fact adds to the humor in this movie in an ironic way.

* The shower scene in Psycho starts out with the character not hearing the killer because the water is ...

## Space and time in films 

* Movie shots are continuous in time and space

* Cuts between shots introduce discontinuities
    * Keep or change viewpoint and location
    * Keep or change time - shorter or longer ellipsis, flashback

* Noël Burch: at least 9-1 = 8 possible space-time cuts (pure viewpoint, pure location, pure ellipsis, pure flashback, ellipsis and viewpoint, ellipsis and location, flashback and viewpoint, flashback and location). 

### Time in games

* Games can be re-played until player succeeds

* Multiple outcomes are possible

* This does not usually happen in film (Groundhog Day)

* Games can be reset and re-started

* Player can die and be born again multiple times
